# THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ON HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES FOR TEN SELECT TN HOSPITALS
In recent years, much effort has been made to understand the relationship between Social
Determinants of Health (SDoH) and excess hospital readmissions, as defined by the Hospital
Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) in the Affordable Care Act of 2012. The literature
suggests that SDoH, which include socioeconomic factors, such as poverty rate, educational
attainment, and housing vacancy rate, when integrated with condition-specific hospital
readmission rates of Medicare patients, can improve quality of care and provide more
equitable care on the part of hospitals, consumers and others with a vested interest.


The intent of this project is to investigate further this relationship by conducting a case study of
4 hospitals located in Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, Savannah, Oak Ridge, Livingston, and Lebanon, TN, respectively.
Using data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the 2013-2017 American
Community Survey (ACS-U.S. Census Bureau), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and CountyHealthRankings.org, I plan to observe these
hospitals in their distinct contexts and answer several questions which I’ll outline below. 

To answer the question of how SDoH might impact readmission rates, I decided to pick 10 
hospitals, 2 from each of the 5 peer groups defined by CMS.
Using data from CMS, I will limit my analysis to the top 3 zip codes each hospital serves and ask
the following sub-questions:

1) What will the data reveal about the socio-economic characteristics of each hospital’s
patient populations? How do these characteristics compare with the larger city
population?

To answer this, I will use the 2013-2017 ACS to examine the metrics of age,
income/employment, poverty, education/literacy, transportation, and housing. I will
also use data on Food Security from the USDA to analyze access to healthy food options
vs. fast food.

2) The CMS defines 6 conditions which are counted in the readmissions reduction
program: heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Which of these conditions are patients most often readmitted for?

Is there any correlation between the condition and any of the SDoH?

For example, one study in Circulation concluded that “education, the most used
indicator of socioeconomic position in the United States, provides the most consistent
results in relation to CVD outcomes. Lower levels of educational attainment are
associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, higher incidence of
cardiovascular events, and higher cardiovascular mortality, independent of
sociodemographic factors.”

Relatedly, how do the risk factors inherent in the SDoH (e.g., lacking reliable
transportation, insufficient housing or means to maintain housing, etc.) generally affect
health outcomes for patients and the number of readmissions, if they do at all?
A study in Health Affairs found that “patients with higher ‘transportation access
risk’ had an average of 41 percent more excess days in the hospital than those
with low transportation access risk. The study defined transportation access risk as ‘the
risk of not having access to private or public transportation for basic health-related
activities, such as getting to medical appointments or getting to a pharmacy to fill a
prescription.’ 

3) Lastly, considering my findings, what would be my recommendation to health care
providers as to how to integrate SDoH with the reduction of the readmission rates?
What can be done within and without the hospital walls to engage patients post-
discharge and mitigate the risk factors inherent in the SDoH?
